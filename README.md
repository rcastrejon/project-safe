# SAFE

Sistema de Administraci√≥n de Flotilla Empresarial (SAFE)

## Requirements

- Latest version of [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- Docker installed and running

## Setup

Create a `.env` file with the **exact same content** as `.env.example` and run the `start-database.sh` script.

The script will create a new database container and start it. You will be asked to generate a password for the database user, just type `Y` to generate a random password. The password will be stored in the `.env` file.

After running the script, a backup of the original `.env` file will be created, just in case you need to restore it. Don't forget to remove the backup file before committing your changes.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```
